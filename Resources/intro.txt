This will upload the anonymized hardware probe to the Linux hardware database. The probe will be published publicly under a permanent URL to view the probe.
           
Private information (including the username, machine's hostname, IP addresses, MAC addresses, UUIDs and serial numbers) is not uploaded to the database.

The tool uploads 32-byte prefix of salted SHA512 hash of MAC addresses/UUIDs and serial numbers to properly distinguish between different computers and hard drives. All the data is uploaded securely via HTTPS.

DISCLAIMER: BY USING THIS UTILITY, YOU AGREE THAT INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR HARDWARE WILL BE UPLOADED TO A PUBLICLY VISIBLE DATABASE. DO NOT USE THIS UTILITY IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THIS.

Please contact https://linux-hardware.org/?view=contacts in case of questions and in case you wish accidentally submitted probes to be removed from the database.
